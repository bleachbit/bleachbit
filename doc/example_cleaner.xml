           Actions generally have two parts: a search method (how to
           find a file) and a command (what to do with the file once
           it is found). You should make the pattern as specific as
           possible to avoid deleting files unintentionally.

    <!-- While the search="..." generates a list of files, you can filter
         the list using any combination of: regex, nregex, and type.

         regex and nregex are both case sensitive and both match just the
