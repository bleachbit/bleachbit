bleachbit.nsi_-_to-dos.txt
==========================

- Update NSIS to v3.04 - maybe use a UMUI-Build from:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ultramodernui/files/UltraModernUI/UltraModernUI%202.0b5/

- Prepare AppVeyor for the builds
  - The versioning for the EXE must have 4 digits!
    I suggest - as AppVeyor adds a build number - to ship the next versions of
    BleachBit - as it seems as Microsoft do, too - with a build number at the end.
  - Make CleanerML accessible for AppVeyor
    - After that the Beta-Tester- & Alpha-Tester-Builds can/should be created

- Pack headers of installers with upx.exe

- Discuss compression vs. extraction time by install

- Discuss if by a update/upgrade the cleaners dir should persist

- Let BleachBit also scan in sub-folders for cleaners - thats makes it possible to uninstall
  beta/alpha cleaners again, because we can place them then in sub-folders

- Review of the English strings used in the Installer/uninstaller

- Review of the local GPLv3 Licenses shiped with BleachBit

- Review of the Language Names translated into the native language

- Ask the artist that did the BleachBit Logo (or a other) if he want to create a skin for the installer

- By full install with Autostart, BleachBit should after Autostart minimize to system tray
  Depends on: https://github.com/bleachbit/wishlist/issues/46

- Discuss future of installer (builds + install types + features)
  - Possible build: Web-Installer
  - Possible feature: Latest Beta & Alpha Cleaner as download
  - Possible feature: English_US-only can download other languages
