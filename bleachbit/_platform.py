""" This module tries to retrieve as much platform-identifying data as
    possible. It makes this information available via function APIs.

    If called from the command line, it prints the platform
    information concatenated as single string to stdout. The output
    format is useable as part of a filename.

#
#    History:
#
#    <see CVS and SVN checkin messages for history>
#
#    1.0.8 - changed Windows support to read version from kernel32.dll
#    1.0.7 - added DEV_NULL
#    1.0.6 - added linux_distribution()
#    1.0.5 - fixed Java support to allow running the module on Jython
#    1.0.4 - added IronPython support
#    1.0.3 - added normalization of Windows system name
#    1.0.2 - added more Windows support
#    1.0.1 - reformatted to make doc.py happy
#    1.0.0 - reformatted a bit and checked into Python CVS
#    0.8.0 - added sys.version parser and various new access
#            APIs (python_version(), python_compiler(), etc.)
#    0.7.2 - fixed architecture() to use sizeof(pointer) where available
#    0.7.1 - added support for Caldera OpenLinux
#    0.7.0 - some fixes for WinCE; untabified the source file
#    0.6.2 - support for OpenVMS - requires version 1.5.2-V006 or higher and
#            vms_lib.getsyi() configured
#    0.6.1 - added code to prevent 'uname -p' on platforms which are
#            known not to support it
#    0.6.0 - fixed win32_ver() to hopefully work on Win95,98,NT and Win2k;
#            did some cleanup of the interfaces - some APIs have changed
#    0.5.5 - fixed another type in the MacOS code... should have
#            used more coffee today ;-)
#    0.5.4 - fixed a few typos in the MacOS code
#    0.5.3 - added experimental MacOS support; added better popen()
#            workarounds in _syscmd_ver() -- still not 100% elegant
#            though
#    0.5.2 - fixed uname() to return '' instead of 'unknown' in all
#            return values (the system uname command tends to return
#            'unknown' instead of just leaving the field empty)
#    0.5.1 - included code for slackware dist; added exception handlers
#            to cover up situations where platforms don't have os.popen
#            (e.g. Mac) or fail on socket.gethostname(); fixed libc
#            detection RE
#    0.5.0 - changed the API names referring to system commands to *syscmd*;
#            added java_ver(); made syscmd_ver() a private
#            API (was system_ver() in previous versions) -- use uname()
#            instead; extended the win32_ver() to also return processor
#            type information
#    0.4.0 - added win32_ver() and modified the platform() output for WinXX
#    0.3.4 - fixed a bug in _follow_symlinks()
#    0.3.3 - fixed popen() and "file" command invocation bugs
#    0.3.2 - added architecture() API and support for it in platform()
#    0.3.1 - fixed syscmd_ver() RE to support Windows NT
#    0.3.0 - added system alias support
#    0.2.3 - removed 'wince' again... oh well.
#    0.2.2 - added 'wince' to syscmd_ver() supported platforms
#    0.2.1 - added cache logic and changed the platform string format
#    0.2.0 - changed the API to use functions instead of module globals
#            since some action take too long to be run on module import
#    0.1.0 - first release
