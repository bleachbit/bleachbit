*** Algorithm
***   --Phase 1
*** - Check if the file has special characteristics (sparse, encrypted,
***   compressed), determine file system (NTFS or FAT), Windows version.
*** - Read the on-disk locations of the file using defrag API.
*** - If file characteristics don't rule it out, just do a direct write
***   of zero-fill on entire file size and flush to disk.
*** - Read back the on-disk locations of the file using defrag API.
*** - If locations are exactly the same, we are done.
*** - Otherwise, enumerate clusters that did not get overwritten in place
***   ("missed clusters").
***   They are probably still untouched, we need to wipe them.
*** - If it was a special file that wouldn't be wiped by a direct write,
***   we will truncate the file and treat it all as missed clusters.
***
***   --Phase 2
*** - (*) Get volume bitmap of free/allocated clusters using defrag API. 
***   Figure out if checkpoint has made our missed clusters available
***   for use again (this is potentially delayed by a few seconds in NTFS).
*** - If they have not yet been made available, wait 0.1s then repeat
***   previous check (*), up to a limit of 7s in polling.
*** - Figure out if it is better to bridge the extents, wiping more clusters
***   but gaining a performance boost from reduced total cycles and overhead.
*** - Recurse over the extents we need to wipe, breaking them down into
***   smaller extents if necessary.
*** - Write a zero-fill file that will provide enough clusters to
***   completely overwrite each extent in turn.
*** - Iterate over the zero-fill file, moving clusters from our zero file
***   to the missed clusters using defrag API.
*** - If the defrag move operation did not succeed, it was probably because
***   another process has grabbed a cluster on disk that we wanted to
***   write to. This can also happen when, by chance, the move's source and
***   target ranges overlap.
*** - In response, we can break the extent down into sub-sections and
***   attempt to wipe each subsection (eventually down to a granularity
***   of one cluster). We also inspect allocated/free sectors to look ahead
***   and avoid making move calls that we know will fail.
*** - If a cluster was allocated by some other Windows process before we could
***   explicitly wipe it, it is assumed to be wiped. Even if Windows writes a
***   small amount of explicit data to a cluster, it seems to write zero-fill
***   out to the end of the cluster to round it out.
***
***
***   TO DO
***   - Test working correctly if per-user disk quotas are in place
